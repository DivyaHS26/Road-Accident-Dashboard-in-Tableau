# Road-Accident-Dashboard-in-Tableau
## Project Objective
To identify patterns and trends in road accident data by building an interactive Tableau dashboard that provides clear and actionable insights. The goal is to support public safety organizations, transport authorities, and policy-makers in understanding accident causes and implementing preventive strategies.


## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/DivyaHS26/Road-Accident-Dashboard-in-Tableau/commit/3f34609d0a650e6f101d9e4e49db39c8497f323d">Accident Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the total number of road accidents recorded?
- How do accidents vary by region and state?
- What time periods show the highest accident rates?
- Which vehicle types are most commonly involved in accidents?
- What is the distribution of accidents based on severity?
- Are there identifiable accident hotspots or high-risk zones?
- What is the trend of fatal vs non-fatal accidents over time?

## Project Scope
This project analyzes structured road accident data using Tableau. It covers accident frequency, severity, vehicle types involved, and temporal patterns. The dashboard enables stakeholders to:
- Explore region-wise and time-wise accident distribution.
- Identify critical hotspots and trends.
- Gain insights into the contributing factors of road mishaps.
The scope is limited to visualization and analysis; prediction or forecasting is outside the current implementation.

## Process
- Data Collection:Collected road accident data from official sources in CSV/Excel format (e.g., government portals or public datasets).
- Data Cleaning & Preparation:Cleaned the dataset by removing null values, fixing inconsistent formats, and filtering irrelevant records.
- Data Import to Tableau:Imported the cleaned dataset into Tableau for visualization and analysis.
- Data Exploration:Analyzed key fields like time of accident, vehicle type, accident location, and fatality count.
- Dashboard Design:Created multiple charts (bar, line, pie, map) to visualize KPIs like accident count, severity, and region-wise breakdown.
- Insight Generation:Interpreted dashboard outputs to derive actionable insights and identify accident hotspots, peak hours, and critical vehicle types.
- Publishing:Finalized the design and shared/exported the dashboard for stakeholders or public viewing via Tableau Public or PDF reports.

## Project Insight
- Peak accident rates were observed during specific months and hours, indicating time-related risk factors.
- Certain states or regions consistently reported higher accident numbers, identifying geographical risk zones.
- Two-wheeler and heavy vehicle involvement was significantly higher in accident records.
- A large proportion of accidents were of medium to high severity, calling for stricter enforcement and safety measures.

 ## Final Conclusion
 The Road Accident Dashboard effectively highlights patterns in road accident data and helps identify areas of concern. Tableauâ€™s interactive visualizations allow users to explore the data from multiple angles, providing valuable insights for decision-making. The project showcases how data visualization can drive road safety initiatives by turning raw data into impactful stories.
